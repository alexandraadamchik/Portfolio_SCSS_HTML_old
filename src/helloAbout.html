        Hi, I'm Alexandra. I'm a web developer, multi-disciplinary maker of useful, curious and beautiful things.  <!-- with over a _____ of experience. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with agencies across the globe to create high performance & rich interactive websites that work across all platforms & devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks, my websites are primarily hand-coded using HTML5 and CSS3.  <!-- SVG & JavaScript. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily
        inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they
        take me. I'm passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a
        natural ability to entertain and inspire. I'm never satisfied to just
        come up with ideas. Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on
        them.
      </p>
              <p>
                I like to develop expertise in a number of areas over the course of my life and career. My personality type is  <a href="http://www.personalitypage.com/html/index.shtml" target="_blank"></a> . </p> <!-- http://www.personalitypage.com/html/index.shtml -->
                <p>I currently work remotely with a selected freelance client base and are open for new opportunities.
